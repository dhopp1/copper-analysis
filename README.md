# copper-analysis
Time series analysis of copper prices using markdown
<br>
## Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to get a better sense of how copper prices behave, with the ultimate goal of being able to identify, with a reasonable degree of certainty, if a day's price is the lowest that can be expected over a 4 week period.  Of course the price of copper is dependent on many different factors, including prices/indicators of other commodities, inventory levels, regulatory announcements, geopolitical conditions in source countries, and indicators of downstream industries.  However for simplicity and ease of use/interpretation, this analysis will stick with only copper's past prices as indicators of its future direction.

The original R markdown file can be rerun, but the final HTML and PDF output are also available in the repository.
